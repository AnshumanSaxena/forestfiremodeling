# Forest Fire Modeling and Visualization Project

A project designed by Anshuman Saxena, June You, Lingxiao Leng, Katty Wu and Aidan Miller for the STAT 385 course offered at the *University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign* during the Spring 2017 semester.

## Description of Project

We intended to create a dynamic and interactive visualization of the occurences of forest fires all over the United States. This visualization was designed to be used as a go-to for online news and media outlets when looking for historical forest fire records and data. 

This project was divided into two major parts: 
* data procurement and cleaning
* data visualization

### Data Procurement and Cleaning

The data was obtained in geospatial format (.shp) from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) website (http://mtbs.gov/data/individualfiredata.html). Since we were not familiar with this type of data, we used the software **QGIS** to convert this data into a *.csv* file. The variables of use to us in this data set were the Latitude, Longitude, Day, Month, Y

### Data Visualization
